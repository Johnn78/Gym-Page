Gym Page

Overview
This webpage was created for the Chingu Voyage 9 pre-work.

LIVE LINK: https://singular-piroshki-bbd659.netlify.app/

Features
This webpage appears a gym page which tries to encourage any athlete to not give up the gym by giving him many exercises via YouTuve videos.

Running The Project / Requirements
The webpage uses technologies by Html, CSS, JavaScript & PHP.
At this time, the webpage is deployed to netlify and the php is the only technology which doesn't work and for this reason the registration 
form not working neither the appearense of arrows next to the carousel/slider. I have put index.html (in case it exists problem with php technology 
as it happened with netlify) & the index.php if you can run in full mode. You can run it as full mode with Xampp.

A simple tutorial how to do it via Xampp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-qXW9ymeYQ&ab_channel=JonahLawrence%E2%80%A2DevProTips
